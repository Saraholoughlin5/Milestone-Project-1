# **<u>Milestone Project 1</u>**

## Freeway Food Market Website

### **<u>Purpose</u>**

The purpose of this website is to provide information to potential customers and vendors alike on the
history of the Freeway Farmer's Market, and to advertise the general products, dates, times and location
of the market, including upcoming events.

Customers will know where and when to attend the market, how to contact the market coordinator,
what type of goods are available, when special events are taking place, and how to receive a newsletter.
Potential vendors will be able to enquire about renting a stall at the market.


### **<u>Details</u>**
&nbsp;
#### **'Home' page**

The homepage header contains an alert and button (link on mobile view) that leads potential vendors to
a form modal enabling them to enquire about renting a stall to sell goods at the market. The form
contains name, phone and email fields, and a submit button. The alert/form is available on all 3 pages.

This is a key feature for the client, as renting stalls ensures continuation of the business and the ability
to pay rent for the market space.

The navigation menu contains Home, About and Contact links (3-page website).

The name and opening hours of the market overlay the main image in the body of the homepage
(jumbotron).

The 'Upcoming Events' section details new and upcoming events where goods are sold outside of the
usual market fare (special interest or non-food related items, such as crafts). Related images included.

The footer contains the addresses for the market venue and office, as well as social media links.
&nbsp;
#### **'About' page**

This page contains the same header and footer information as the homepage. The body of the page
contains the name of the market with a portion of the homepage main image as a background.

Beneath the main image an 'About the Market' section displays text sections which outline the history of
the market and provides details on what goods are for sale. Related images included.
&nbsp;
#### **'Contact' page**

The contact page contains the same header and footer information as the homepage. The body of the
page contains the name of the market with a portion of the homepage main image as a background.

Beneath the main image a 'Contact Us' section displays name, address, phone and email information
beneath a 'Details' heading (left) and a 'Newsletter' email submission form and image (right). In mobile
view the 'Newsletter' appears beneath the 'Details' and the image is removed.

&nbsp;
### **<u>Responsivity</u>**

The website for the Freeway Farmer's Market is responsive across a number of browsers, devices and
orientations. In the mock-ups, the scrollbar has been used to show the lower part of the pages in some
instances.

&nbsp;
### **<u>UX (User Experience)</u>**
&nbsp;
#### **Strategy Plane**

The website is required to generate income for the client by promoting the market to both customers
and vendors. The user’s needs are met, as the site provides relevant and accessible information.
&nbsp;
#### **Scope Plane**

Features available in the website include an alert that encourages potential vendors to contact the site
owners at the click of a button. A newsletter can be easily subscribed to on the 'Contact' page. Social
media icons (currently linking to the site's homepages) are available in the footer on all pages. Address
and contact details are also available.

&nbsp;
#### **Structure Plane**

The structure of the website is uncluttered and easily navigated. Users can navigate between the 3 site
pages via the navigation menu items. Ample opportunity is provided to contact the client, for example,
via the alert button, the 'Contact' navigation menu link and a link to the 'Contact' page in the 'Upcoming
Event' text. Social media links lead to the homepage of each site, but would lead to a business site if
available for a live business. Address details are also provided in the footer.

&nbsp;
#### **Skeleton Plane**

Wireframes were created to plan the initial layout of each webpage, detailing where each section,
button and link would be placed. For example, it was determined that adding a form modal to an alert
aimed at vendors may encourage them to apply to rent a stall moreso than if the alert was not present.
Layout of text and images and how each site page would look at various sizes were also determined.
Wireframes for the site are available below.

&nbsp;
#### **Surface Plane**

The colour palette was chosen to reflect the enticing, fresh and vitality-based qualities of the product.
The font families suit the theme of the website and product also. The images are dynamic and bright,
and do not clash with the site colour palette.

&nbsp;

### **<u>Deployment</u>**

&nbsp;
#### **Website Creation in Notepad++**
The website was built offline in Notepad++ and copied to GitPod at various milestones.

&nbsp;
#### **Website Build in GitHub and GitPod**

In GitHub, I logged in and clicked on the ‘New’ button in the left-hand menu. On the ‘Create a New Repository’ page, I clicked on the ‘Repository Template’ button and chose the ‘Code Institute’ template provided.
I checked the ‘Include all branches’ tick-box. I entered ‘MilestoneProject-1’ in the ‘Repository Name’ field, left the radio button checked at ‘Public’, and clicked on the ‘Create Repository’ button. 
Once in the new repository, I clicked on ‘GitPod’ in my browser extensions to open the workspace. The ‘index.html’ and ‘style.css’ files were created, with the CSS file being added to the ‘assets/css’ folder.
Much of the code was initially created in Notepad++ then copied to GitPod. Images were added to the ‘assets/images’ folder. 
The following command was entered in the terminal to open port 8000 to view the html file in the browser: ‘python3 -m http.server’. 
Commands were also used to add files, commit changes with comments, push to the repository: git add, git commit and git push. 
The status was checked using ‘git status’.

&nbsp;
#### **Viewing the Live Website with GitHub Pages**

In the MilestoneProject-1 repository on GitHub, I clicked on the ‘Settings’ tab and scrolled down to the
GitHub Pages section. I chose ‘Master Branch’ and ‘Save’, then I clicked on the link to successfully view
the live page.
